# LCSC component library for KiCAD 6 (5.99 nightly)

New components are added regularly.

## FAQ
* Why only support KiCAD 6, when it's not stable yet?
  * The [https://github.com/tjclement/easyeda2kicad](easyeda2kicad) library that's used currently only supports v6, and since v6 is really nice to use, I didn't port the lib to v5.
